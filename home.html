  <h2> Our Goal </h2>

</center>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Hospitals and technology have forever been apart, but Medbot seeks to bridge that distance, with its mission to minimize waiting time and maximize efficiency in hospitals, streamlining the experience for both medical practioners and patients alike. Hospitals incorporated with technology like this can be used to forge new levels of unity between the two, leading to a better, technological future, for all. Medbot is an online tool avaliable to patients and doctors, with varying platforms to exercise its efficiency. Patients will be able to book their appointments and fill out their medical forms, rather than waiting for hours on end in line, while practioners will be able to view all their patient's information in one place, causing a reduction of wasted time for both parties. Medbot is the future of incorporated medical technology, not in the field itself, but as a supporting mechanism to a merged, more intuitve experience. </p>
